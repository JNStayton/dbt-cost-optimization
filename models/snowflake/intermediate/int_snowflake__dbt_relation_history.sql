{#--
  Cross-environment dbt relation history.

  Discovers all physical materializations of dbt models across environments
  (dev, staging, prod) by parsing DDL statements from the staged query history.

  Maps each logical dbt model (node_id) to every physical FQN where it has been
  materialized. Enables cross-environment recommendation deduplication and
  identification of models that exist in non-prod but haven't reached prod yet.

  Grain: one row per physical relation (table_fqn). A table built under several target
  names (e.g. a dbt platform Studio session that appears as both 'default' and 'dev')
  is one deployment, not several: target_name is the latest build's target, and
  target_names / dbt_cloud_environment_ids list every one seen. Keeping one row per
  table keeps every join on table_fqn one-to-one, so recommendations aren't multiplied.

  Rebuilt as a table on every run from stg_snowflake__query_history (which keeps the
  history), over dbt_relation_history_lookback_days. An incremental merge would
  overwrite first_built_at, build_count and the lists with only the re-scanned window.

  is_excluded: the dbt_excluded_schemas / dbt_excluded_targets vars (see
  relation_is_excluded). Excluded deployments are left out of recommendations and
  deployed_relation_count.
